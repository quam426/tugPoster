# tugPoster
LaTeX Document Class for nice Posters

tugPoster provides a LaTeX class that aims to greatly simplify the process of creating nice-looking posters for conferences or exhibitions. 
The poster follows the design guidelines of Graz University of Technology. However, adaptations of color, logos, etc. are easily possible.

The tugPoster class makes among others heavy used of the LaTeX packages 'tcolorbox', 'tikz', and 'enumitems'.

The content is organized in individual blocks which can either span the whole width, be layout in two columns and the content of a block can also be either single
column or two columns. Dedicated content blocks for the abstract and references are available.

In the footer several logos of e.g., project partners or funding agencies can be placed and optional a QR-code is shown that redirects to a URL with further information.

For a detailed introduction along with many examples how to use this class please see the PDF in the 'Tutorial' folder. 
All sample posters can be found in the 'src' subfolder under 'Tutorial'. Samples of more complex posters can be found in 'Tutorial/src/samplePoster'.
